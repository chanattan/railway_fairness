# Measuring fairness in railway networks: graph theory meets social choice

## Project
This research project is a research internship conducted in the LAMSADE, Paris Dauphine - PSL, in Paris. It was supervised by Jérôme Lang, Arianna Novaro (Université Paris 1), and Florian Sikora. 

Railway networks present iniquities in different aspects. For example, in France, some travellers who may want to take the train to go from Poitiers to Lyon (two cities in France) are forced to go to a central city, Paris.
Whereas a more optimal (distance-wise) path would be a straight line, more efficient by a sqrt(2) factor. Notably, the trip would be longer, hold a bigger carbon footprint, and cost higher.
Let alone France's case, such iniquities are yet to be perfectly quantified. We aim in this project to use graph theory and social choice, to measure these by evaluating social choice measures (e.g., p-Social Welfare) and tailored ones, on railway networks at a national scale.

## Progress

France's railway network is already available online at https://chanattan.github.io/railway.html, population threshold is a parameter which can be played with to yield different railway networks.
A railway network is graph where nodes can be considered as cities, and edges as train lines (i.e., there exists one train which goes from the first city to the second in a consecutive way, let alone filtered out cities).

## Thanks

I would like to thank the support of some members of Open Data SNCF's team (in France) with our work on GTFS data.
